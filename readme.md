# Text_Generation_Project

The data here trained on the Frankenstein or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and made to generate the text.

## Improper text Generation

The text generated by the model does not make sense because the no of epochs I used is 4 but to generate a proper text, an epoch value of 100 is needed. It may take to longer time to run bigger epoch.

# Reference to the Frankenstein txt

The Frankenstein txt is added to the Github of this project but the actual text was obtained from [Asweigart Github](https://github.com/asweigart/codebreaker/blob/master/frankenstein.txt).
